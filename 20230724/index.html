      Explanation: We set a max-width of 400px for the container, which means it
      won't grow beyond this width. The container is styled as a flex container
      with display: flex; to allow the input element to adjust its width. The
      align-items: center; ensures the input is vertically centered within the
      container. The input element has flex: 1;, allowing it to grow and shrink
      to fill the available space within the container. The max-width: 100%; for
      the input box ensures it won't grow beyond the container's width. The
      box-sizing: border-box; ensures that the padding and border are included
      in the specified width, preventing the input box from exceeding the
      container's width.Explanation: We set a max-width of 400px for the
